Reconnaissance using Google dorks

Vidwan is a simple tool which uses the exploit-db's GHDB database and other openly available google dorks for recon of an online domain.

The main objective to start this project was to have an updated local copy of openly available dorks with easy search function similar to explot-db's searchsploit tool in kali linux. Further, online searches yielded me no good results for a tool which could perform a mass dork search using live updated Dorks database for a supplied domain.

Vidwan has 2 modules. 

1. Updater.py - This updates local sqlite database (GHDB.db - a local copy of GHDB) with the dorks present in GHDB (https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/?action=search&ghdb_search_page=1) : Current Staus - Working
GHDB.db has been initially updated with openly available dorks such as FSDB (Foundstone Dorks).This tool updates the GHDB.db with newly published dorks at GHDB site over and above the present set of dorks available in the local DB. In case you find any other live maintained dork site or any good resource of google dorks, please contact me (email address given below) , so that the same could be updated as part of Updater.py script or the GHDB.db.

2. Dork_Search.py - Searches for a supplied domain against selected gooogle dorks from GHDB.db in google search engine and returns a set of URLs (if any) : Current Status - Yet To Start. 

The project is currently under development. 

However, the GHDB.db and Updater.py will be of lot of help if you are planning to write any customised script of your own for a Dork search. Feel free to modify and use it.
